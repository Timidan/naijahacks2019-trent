## Problem Statement:

Several property owners are involved in the Land Registration Bureaucratic Process which means that there is poor record that is kept for land owners(both existing and aspiring. Also, there are limited sources of funding since the idea of crowdfunding has been waived due to high corrupt practices and as an issue of poor documentation, land ownership records have very low integrity.

## Solution

A web3 based website focused on making real estate more easier; Trent focuses on solving real estate Operability problems by introducing blockchain into the traditional real estate processes by eliminating middlemen and improving real estate services by introducing tokenized ownership through the awesome power of smart contracts, prevention of title fraud, crowdfunding investments and title transfer transparency.
